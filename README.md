# Airline-ticket-reservation-system
This Airline Ticket Reservation System Project was developed using PHP/MySQLi. This ticket reservation system of an airline company serves as the online platform for the Passengers/Customers to book or reserve their tickets.
With the help of this system, passengers can reserve their flights easily and faster wherever they are. This will also help the airline company to ease the manual system flow and make their work/process more effective and efficient.
The system has 2 types of users: Admin and Customer. 
The Admin user is in charge of managing the data of the system such as the list of jets, prices, and flight schedules.
The customer can simply register to create an account in the system and search if there's an available/scheduled flight for their desired destination and date.
After they select their desired flight the system will provide a form to register the details of the passengers and proceed to payment afterward. The customer can also print/re-print their tickets in the system.
